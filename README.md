## Project: Traffic sign recognizer using Pytorch.

In this project, I have implemented a VGG architecture inspired CNN model that classifies 43 different traffic signs that are commonly seen on roads. 

My main goal in this project is to build a CNN model that peforms well on test dataset by experimenting on various regularization techniques available in Pytorch library such as BatchNorm, applied data augmentation on training images for better generalization, leveraging different optimizers and check how it varies the end result accuracy. 

Achieved 96.38% accuracy on validation set and 96.38% accuracy on test dataset.
